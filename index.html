        <p class="lead">"It is a great privilege to have Leah as our Hebrew teacher. Not only does she teach us the
          Hebrew language, including vocabulary and grammar &ndash; with lots of opportunity to practice conversational
          Hebrew &ndash; but she also helps us to analyze Hebrew stories to uncover deeper meaning beneath the written
          words." &mdash;Judy P.</p>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <p class="lead">"I write to provide a testimonial on behalf of Leah, who has been my teacher for about two
          years. Leah is a gifted teacher. She is knowledgeable and very well prepared. She has infinite patience with
          her sometimes thickheaded student &ndash; me &ndash; and always assures that learning takes place. Leah is
          smart, well prepared and conscientious &ndash; and injects a note of humor when appropriate. I love her as a
          teacher; I admire her as a person; I value her as a friend." &mdash;Stella S. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="jumbotron more">
        <p class="lead">"I am writing this letter of recommendation for Leah, who has been my Hebrew teacher for over a
          year. She leads our small class of intermediate to advanced students very capably. Leah encourages us to
          converse with her in Hebrew about our lives. She provides lessons in grammar, and introduces us to words and
          phrases that are currently used in Israel. When we read a story in Hebrew, in addition to translating, she
          guides us to determine the intent of the author. She engages us by bringing in stories, poems and songs
          relating to holidays. Her homework assignments are imaginative. We are asked to devices alternate endings to
          the stories we are reading. We explore the background of the stories, and how they relate to the history of
          Israel." &mdash;Shelly G. </p>
